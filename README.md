## ðŸ“Œ Introduction
Productivity-app is a web application inspired by [100 Blocks a Day](https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/10/100-blocks-day.html) by Tim urban. We get 24 hours each day which is 144 ten-minute blocks.Itâ€™s always good to step back and think about how weâ€™re using those 144 blocks we get each day.Youâ€™d have to think about everything you might spend your time doing in the context of its worth in blocks. Cooking dinner requires three blocks, while ordering in requires zeroâ€”is cooking dinner worth three blocks to you? Is 10 minutes of meditation a day important enough to dedicate a block to it?
