## 📌 Introduction
Productivity-app is a web application inspired by [100 Blocks a Day](https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/10/100-blocks-day.html) by Tim urban. We get 24 hours each day which is 144 ten-minute blocks.It’s always good to step back and think about how we’re using those 144 blocks we get each day.You’d have to think about everything you might spend your time doing in the context of its worth in blocks. Cooking dinner requires three blocks, while ordering in requires zero—is cooking dinner worth three blocks to you? Is 10 minutes of meditation a day important enough to dedicate a block to it?
